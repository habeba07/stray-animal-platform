Follow these guidelines to stay safe:</p>\n                \n                <h3>1. Observe from a Distance</h3>\n                <p>Before approaching, observe the dog's body language. Look for signs of fear or aggression like raised hackles, bared teeth, or a stiff tail. If the dog appears aggressive, do not approach.</p>\n                \n                <h3>2. Approach Slowly</h3>\n                <p>If the dog seems calm, approach slowly from the side rather than head-on. Avoid direct eye contact as dogs may perceive this as a threat.</p>\n                \n                <h3>3. Use a Calm, Gentle Voice</h3>\n                <p>Speak softly and reassuringly. Avoid high-pitched excited tones that might agitate the dog.</p>\n                \n                <h3>4. Offer Food</h3>\n                <p>If possible, offer food by gently tossing it toward the dog rather than extending your hand immediately.</p>\n                \n                <h3>5. Use Proper Equipment</h3>\n                <p>If you're planning to rescue the dog, have a slip lead, carrier, or other appropriate equipment ready.</p>\n                \n                <h3>6. Know When to Call Professionals</h3>\n                <p>If the dog appears injured or aggressive, contact animal control or a local rescue organization instead of attempting to handle the situation yourself.</p>\n                \n                <h3>Safety First</h3>\n                <p>Remember that your safety is the priority.
